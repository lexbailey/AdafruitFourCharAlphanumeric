This is a library written for the Raspberry Pi for controlling an Adafruit four char Alphanumeric display with I2C backpack.

This probably works well with beaglebone too although not tested. May need some alteration to I2C calls to support BBB.

To install, clone this repo and copy AdafruitFourCharAlphanumeric.py into your project directory and then use code like the code in example.py

Basic use is like this:

  from AdafruitFourCharAlphanumeric import FourCharDisplay

  myDisplay = FourCharDisplay(0x70)

  myDisplay.write("ABCD")

In this example the display is on the address 0x70. This is the default for the backpack module.
If you have soldered any address jumpers then this value will change. The address is in the range 0x70..0x77.

You can set the display to blink using by setting the display setup register

  myDisplay.set_register(myDisplay.FOUR_CHAR_REG_DISP_SET | 
			myDisplay.FOUR_CHAR_DISP_ON | 
			myDisplay.FOUR_CHAR_DISP_BLINK_1HZ)

The blink options are:

  FOUR_CHAR_DISP_BLINK_OFF
  FOUR_CHAR_DISP_BLINK_1HZ
  FOUR_CHAR_DISP_BLINK_2HZ
  FOUR_CHAR_DISP_BLINK_HALF_HZ

You can also display a custom character by calling write_raw. For example

  myDisplay.write_raw(0, 0b0000000011110111)

Will show an upper case 'A' on character 0.
The first parameter is the character to which you are writing. This must be in the range 0..3

The write function will pad with extra spaces if the input is not four characters long.
So...

  myDisplay.write("    ")

is the same as

  myDisplay.write("")
